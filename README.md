This repository accompanies a blog post: http://blog.alexellis.io/piwars-v2-0/

The state of this repository will start as a code-dump and will be gradually documented as time permits. 

### Todo:

```
[x] Scrape Python code from robot
[ ] Re-test python code after being mothballed
[ ] Link back to blog post
[ ] Find / reconstitute Arduino motor-controller code in C
```
